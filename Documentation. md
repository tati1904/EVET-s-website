# Design Decision
## Project Cocept
The EVETâ€™s Cake Shop project aims to create a visually appealing and user-friendly website for a fictional bakery. The design focuses on ease of navigation, engaging visuals, and functional interactivity. Key design decisions include:

Color Scheme: The website uses a light beige color (#ffebcd) for the header, navigation bar, and chat box to create a warm and inviting atmosphere, suitable for a bakery setting.
Typography: The choice of 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, and sans-serif fonts ensures a clean and modern look. This combination enhances readability and aligns with contemporary web design standards.
Layout: The layout is structured to provide a clear hierarchy of information. The navigation bar is prominently displayed at the top, followed by the main content area, and a fixed chat box to ensure constant availability of support.
## Responsive Design
The site is designed to be responsive, adjusting to various screen sizes using CSS properties like max-height, width, and object-fit. This ensures that the site is accessible and user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.
# Development Process
## Stages

Planning: Defined the project scope, including the required pages (Home, Catalogue, Blog, Gallery, and Contact Us) and key features (navigation menu, chat box).
Design: Created wireframes and mockups to visualize the layout, design, and interactive elements of the website.
Implementation:
HTML: Developed the structure of each page using semantic HTML tags.
CSS: Applied styling to ensure a cohesive and visually appealing design. CSS rules were written to handle layout, typography, colors, and responsive design.
JavaScript: Added interactivity, particularly for the chat box functionality.
Testing: Reviewed the design across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
Deployment: Prepared the project for deployment, including setting up the hosting environment (e.g., GitHub Pages).
## Methodologies

## Challenges Faced
Cross-Browser Compatibility:

Issue: Styling inconsistencies across different browsers.
Solution: Used standardized CSS properties and tested the design on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Applied browser-specific prefixes where necessary.
Responsive Design Adjustments:

Issue: Ensuring the layout adapts well on various devices.
Solution: Utilized flexible grid layouts and media queries to adjust styles based on screen size. Fine-tuned breakpoints for optimal display on both mobile and desktop devices.
JavaScript Integration:

Issue: Implementing a chat box that toggles visibility.
Solution: Developed a simple JavaScript function to handle the display of the chat box. The script listens for click events on the chat box header and toggles the visibility of the chat box.
